# Crypto-Disclosures

## Abstract

In the financial sector, it is normal for TV pundits, article authors
and bloggers to disclose that they have a financial stake in the
company being blogged/written/talked about.  The crypto industry
should establish similar processes, to demonstrate best practices to
the community and increase total community transparency.
